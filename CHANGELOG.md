## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Marine domain scaffolding**: `MarineDomain` class with `ZoneState`, `StaticDriver`, and `MarineConfig` (pydantic-validated)
- **TroutState marine fields**: 5 new fields — `zone_idx`, `sea_winters`, `smolt_date`, `natal_reach_idx`, `smolt_readiness`
- **Smolt exit**: PARR fish transition to SMOLT at river mouth when `marine` config section present
- **Smolt readiness**: Spring-window photoperiod + temperature accumulation drives PARR→SMOLT transition
- **Zone migration**: Time-based SMOLT→OCEAN_JUVENILE→OCEAN_ADULT transitions through Estuary→Coastal→Baltic zones
- **Adult return**: OCEAN_ADULT fish return to natal freshwater reach with valid `cell_idx`
- **Freshwater zone_idx guards**: 10 alive-fish loops guarded to exclude marine fish from freshwater calculations
- **Example marine config**: `configs/example_marine.yaml` with 3 Baltic Sea zones
- **E2E lifecycle test**: Full freshwater→marine→return cycle verified

### Changed
- Existing configs without a `marine` section are fully backward-compatible — no behaviour change

### Infrastructure
- 766 tests (was 729), all passing

---
